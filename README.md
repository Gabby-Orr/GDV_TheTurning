# The Turning
#### Intro to Game Development - Final Project - Fall 2020
The Turning is a tile-based puzzle/horror game set in a hospital during the zombie apocalypse. You are tasked with using the hospital's facilities and supplies to create a cure, solving various puzzles to do so. However, time is not on your side â€” you are infected, and will have to face your own symptoms as they progress. Collect the ingredients, finish the cure, and escape the hospital before your Turning is complete.
